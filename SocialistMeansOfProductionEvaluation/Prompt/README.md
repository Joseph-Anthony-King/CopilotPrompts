The bourgeoisie state has been abolished, and the goal is to develop a workers' federation based on free association. In recognition of the fact that society has been hierarchical "the state" remains to perform administrative functions and to defend against counter revolution. One of the goals of this system is to center the new society's values into the very fabric of the financial system to make it safe for a multi-party democracy. This new system seeks to foster solidarity and to fundamentally change the role of the state for society. In recognition of this fact that this institution has the aspiration to become a horizontal society it is known as "the federation".

The federation’s government has four branches: the executive, the legislative, the judicial, and the economic. The legislative branch originates policy, the executive enacts policy, the judicial branch resolves disputes and the economic branch oversee the macroeconomy and all public utilities. Public utilities are essential goods and services for which market mechanisms lead to suboptimal outcomes of delivery of these goods and services to society. This includes goods and services like education, healthcare, finance, transportation, internet, etc. As society develops new areas of the economy can be added under administration of this branch as determined by the legislative branch of government. The economic branch of government is structured as a series of assemblies and standing committees which oversee these services at local and national levels. At the point of service this branch of government contracts with a workers' cooperative which provides the service. In recognition of the fact that the bourgeoisie state was designed for extraction this government is designed to hopefully, eventually, wither away as with time is hoped the first three branches become superfluous leaving behind public administration of the economy. Once that is deemed sufficient the other three branches can simply close their contracts. Until then, to the extent that any public officials are required they will be paid based on the following formula: Median Average Renumeration * 33%. As much as possible, government service should be deemed a privilege and should not be paid. To the extent that campaigns require funding, that funding must be public and campaigns cannot last more than a quarter of a year. To the extent that the federation requires funding that funding should be provided by taxes assessed against cooperatives and sole proprietorships, there should be no individual income taxes.

There is no passive income. There are no rents or private landownership. Instead, title to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use; legitimate ownership is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative. Land is commonly held and run by local resident councils who manage access to the parcels, contract with workers' cooperatives to provide services such as community safety, fire, garbage collection, etc. A small fee is charged to cover services. Every individual has a guaranteed right to claim a parcel of land for a dwelling for personal residence, provided they occupy and use it. Local resident councils must maintain sufficient housing stock or land availability to satisfy this right. They also control access to land for cooperatives.

In this economic system, labor has primacy over capital. The labor market has been abolished, and no one can work for a wage or a salary. Instead, the institution of economic organization in this system is the workers' cooperative, though sole proprietorships are permitted. Yet, it is important to note that whenever two or more workers are involved in an enterprise that enterprise must be cooperative. Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned by the members on behalf of society. Every member has a stake and one person, one vote in all workers' cooperative matters. Regarding remuneration, there cannot be more than a 33% difference between the highest-paid and lowest-paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops. The unions provide support and settle internal disputes that the cooperatives cannot resolve as well as providing training and they serve as clearing houses for economic conditions.

The distributive principle of this society is from each according to ability, to each according to labor. From there it is dependent on the laborers to distribute the fruits of their labor to the whole of society.

This principle is enacted via labor certificates. Labor certificates are a species of currency which facilitate trade and are ultimately under the auspices of the finance bureau of the economic branch of government. At the national level this bureau controls the total pool of capital in the system. At the local level workers' cooperatives establish People's Banks, which are local financial institutions which control the flow of capital. The banks are polycentric planning nodes; they have knowledge of the local conditions on the ground and can assess worker cooperative production plans. The way these certificates work is a cooperative submits its production plan, this can be for any timeframe, it can be a month, a year, 5 years, etc. This allows society to have as much or as little structure around economic planning as they deem they are ready for. In this plan all values are calculated using the labor theory of value. The prices of all inputs are assumed to have accounted for the just renumeration of the workers who came before. Once this plan is ready it is submitted to the People's Bank. The bank can evaluate the plan and adjust the plan in consultation with the cooperative. Once the plan is agreed upon the bank funds the plan and the labor certificates begin their circulation. The labor certificates circulate for five years after which time they are no longer valid... except for one more transaction. To close the circuit once a certificate has expired it is good for one more transaction that way the holder of this certificate can redeem the value retained within the labor certificate. Upon expiration the holder of the certificate can redeem the certificate at a Mutual Aid Society Store. These mutual aid societies will be playing a role in welfare and will be further described below.

The theoretical basis of these certificates is that capital is in fact a social resource. Many of the prior suboptimal conditions under capitalism were born of the contradiction that capital is a social resource, a relation, that is represented by currency. This currency can command labor so in this society this currency is treated as a social pool from which people can draw on to fund productive work. Such work even includes social reproduction in the form of service provided to others. In cases where such services are warranted but would not be deemed profitable under capitalist finance, these services would qualify for funding as a capital outlay, not a loan, because productive work is being performed which adds in social reproduction of ensure equitable distribution of resources. A way to think of this is the recipient is a client and you're drawing on their funds to provide them with a service.

The federation is not a welfare state and specifically rejects this model in exchange for publicly subsidized mutual aid as it fosters solidarity and social cohesion. People are encouraged to join mutual aid societies which are partially subsidized directly by the financial system, not by the federation. There is a federation-sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who cannot join another group that would serve as a society of last resort, but people do have the ability to opt out of the system. Even then, in such cases the society of last resort will still cover these people if they should request services. The hope is these society will also serve a socializing function that will make them attractive to people, so they want to join. The mutual aid societies contract with workers' cooperatives to provide administrative services. For justified services which exceed the mutual aid society’s ability to pay, this could include hiring professionals, services, medical care, etc., the mutual aid society would qualify for capital outlays as described above.

These groups encourage mutual aid and mutual dependence rather than dependence on the federation.

Regarding foreign investment it is recognized that labor certificates are conceptually different enough from money as conceived of in the capitalist sense that this could cause a problem for settling and managing our foreign obligations to address the wrongs of imperialism. Therefore, labor certificates provide a mechanism that permits them to hold value while trading in foreign contexts. There are "savings accounts" which are accounts where the certificate can be held and its expiration will be temporarily paused. At this point, the certificates can be traded on the international market as money. It is recognized this opens the economy up to foreign dependencies, but it is also important that we recognize our obligations to the world as a whole and provide ourselves with a way to interface with global commerce. This also allows cooperatives to save credits as for citizens of the federation such accounts can only be held by groups like cooperatives, mutual aid societies, families, churches, etc.

Regarding foreign investment, foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives to produce goods and services. In such cases, the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery and can pay the workers' cooperative for the work in foreign currency, which they will then submit to the People's Banks for conversion into credits, the Bank can then hold the foreign currency in reserve. This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign currency to facilitate international trade.

With the above, can you assess the likely material conditions for such a society and how would you define this economic system?
