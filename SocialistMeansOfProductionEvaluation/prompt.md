I'm going to describe an economic system to you and I want you to give me the likely material conditions that would result from this means of production.

In this economic system labor has primacy over capital.  The labor market has been abolished and no one can work for a wage or a salary.  Instead, the institution of economic  organization in this system is the workers' cooperative.  Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned.  Every member has a stake and 1 person/1 vote in all workers' cooperative matters.  In regards to enumeration there cannot be more than a 25% spread between the highest paid and lowest paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops.  The unions provide support and settle internally disputes the cooperatives can't handle internally.

The way these cooperatives work is they devise their production plans indicating what they plan on purchasing.  All commodities and services are priced according to the labor theory of value.  The assumption is the market price the cooperative pays is as close the real price as possible.  These prices are used as signals to indicate value throughout the system.

Once the cooperative plan is ready it is submitted to a People's Banks.  The concept of the People's Banks is inspired by Proudhon's concept of the People's Bank.

However, unlike with Proudhon, the People's Banks are not a monopoly.  Instead, the People's Banks are workers' cooperatives who manage the financial sector of the economy.  The People's Banks review the cooperative proposal, can make adjustments in conjunction with the cooperative, and then issues a loan in credits to fund the production or the service.  These credits then circulate through the economy in order to facilitate commerce.
As the cooperative than sells their products or services they pay the loan back.  These loans provide a small boost to the People's Banks in order to cover their operations only.

The credits issued by the People's Banks are a form or demurrage currency as they expire five years after issuance.

Some added point regarding these credits.  If placed in a "savings" account the credits are frozen for the time they are in the account.  Once released from the account they are equivalent in value to contemporary credits.
Foreigners can make use of such accounts to preserve their value for future use.

In regards to foreign investment foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives in order to produce goods and services.  In such cases the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery and they can pay for the work in foreign currency which the People's Banks will convert into credits for internal use.  This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign money to facilitate foreign trade.
For countries adopting our economic system we would simply add them to the same economic area.

The state has been abolished and replaced with a workers' federation based in Free association, not on the monopoly of violence. This isn't a welfare state.  Instead, people are encouraged to join publicly subsidized mutual aid associations.  There is a federation sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who can't join another group.

These groups encourage mutual aid and dependency on each other rather than on the federation.

The federation exists for the benefit of the members.  It provides services and utilities to the cooperatives in order to facilitate their operation.

Among these services the federation can commission special federations of workers' cooperatives in order to complete mega projects.  It can also coordinate research projects for industries by accepting contributions from cooperatives which would entitle them to the benefits of the research.

There is no passive income.  There are no rents or private land ownership.  Instead a title of property to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use where in legitimate ownership of land is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative.
