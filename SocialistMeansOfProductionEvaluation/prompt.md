I'm going to describe an economic system to you, and I want you to give me the likely material conditions that would result from this means of production.

The state has been abolished and replaced with a workers' federation whose legitimacy rests on the continued, voluntary acceptance of its members to work together in free association, rather than on a state monopoly of violence.

The federation’s government has four branches. The executive branch composed of an elected council. The legislative branch consists of a lower house elected by way of proportional representation on the basis of administrative representive units and an upper house analogous to a house of lords, with the upper chamber composed of the descendants of Indigenous North Americans and the descendants of enslaved peoples.  The upper house merely has the power to veto actions of the lower house, similar to the house of lords. A judicial branch adjudicates disputes and interprets federation charters. A fourth branch manages all public utilities.  Any public service that requires generalized infrastructure and provides a common service to all would qualify as a utility and would call under the fourth branch of government, utility commissions.  This includes water, garbage collection, finance, transportation, education, research, internet services, energy, healthcare, etc.  This branch consists of the services it provides with local assemblies for feedback and local input on services.  This branch contracts out with workers' cooperatives who would provide the actual services with those contracts controlled by the utlitity commission which receives public input.

It is important to note that credits only have value due to work performed in their generation, credits will be described further below, they are a form of demurrage currency and that effects how they are used significantly.  As such, this understanding of the origin of the credits as a public utility permits provisioning for such credits as capital outlays if they would not prove financially viable as a loan. This is to ensure provisioning for needs which may not traditionally be seen as economically viable.

The federation is not a welfare state. Instead, people are encouraged to join mutual aid societies which are partially subsidies directly by the financial system. There is a federation-sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who cannot join another group.  The mutual aid societies contract with workers' cooperatives to provide administrative services. For justified work which exceeds the mutual aid societies ability to pay, this could include hiring professionals, services, medical care, etc., the mutual aid society would qualify for capital outlays as described above.

These groups encourage mutual aid and mutual dependence rather than dependence on the federation.

There is no passive income. There are no rents or private landownership. Instead, title to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use; legitimate ownership is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative.  Land is commonly held and run by local resident councils who manage access to the parcels, contract with workers' cooperatives to provide services such as community safety, fire, garbage collection, etc. A small fee is charged to cover services. Every individual has a guaranteed right to claim a parcel of land or a dwelling for personal residence, provided they occupy and use it. Local resident councils must maintain sufficient housing stock or land availability to satisfy this right.

In this economic system, labor has primacy over capital. The labor market has been abolished, and no one can work for a wage or a salary. Instead, the institution of economic organization in this system is the workers' cooperative. Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned. Every member has a stake and one person, one vote in all workers' cooperative matters. Regarding remuneration, there cannot be more than a 33% spread between the highest-paid and lowest-paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops. The unions provide support and settle internal disputes that the cooperatives cannot resolve.

These cooperatives devise production plans indicating what they plan to purchase. All commodities and services are priced according to the labor theory of value. The assumption is that the market price the cooperative pays is as close to the real price as possible. These prices are used as signals of value throughout the system.

Once a cooperative's plan is ready, it is submitted to a People's Bank. The concept of the People's Banks is inspired by Proudhon's People's Bank.

However, unlike Proudhon's model, the People's Banks are not a monopoly. Instead, the People's Banks are workers' cooperatives that manage the financial sector of the economy as a public utility.  As a utility, oversight of the People's Banks falls under the utility commissions branch of the federation government. The People’s Banks review cooperative proposals and can make adjustments in conjunction with the cooperative and then issue loans in credits to fund production or services. These credits then circulate through the economy to facilitate commerce. As a cooperative then sells its products or services, it repays the loan. These loans provide a small boost to the People's Banks to cover operating costs only.

The credits issued by the People's Banks are a form of demurrage currency, as they expire five years after issuance. There are "savings accounts" where credits can be placed on hold and will not age for the time they are held within the account.  Once released the credits have the same value as credits circulating concurrently.  In recognition of the fact that capital is social in nature no member of the workers' federation can open such accounts individually.  Only cooperatives can use such accounts to assist in resource planning and to account for projects which would exceed the 5-year time frame for which the credits are usually valid.  Additionally, foreigners from capitalist economies can use such accounts such that credits can be viewed as fiat currency within their respective economies.  They would simply save the credits in the account and pull them from the account when needed.

Regarding foreign investment, foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives to produce goods and services. In such cases, the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery, and can pay the workers' cooperative for the work in foreign currency, which they will then submit to the People's Banks for conversion into credits, the Bank can then hold the foreign currency in reserve. This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign currency to facilitate international trade. For countries adopting this economic system, we would add them to the same economic area.  When held in a savings account the credits can be traded internationally.  This will allow an exchange rate to develop between the credits and captialist currencies.

In sum, this system centers democratically governed workers’ cooperatives, non-monopolistic People’s Banks issuing demurrage credits, occupancy-and-use access to land and housing, and a federation whose authority derives from voluntary association and plural governance. The intent is to foreground labor, mutual aid, and social solidarity while enabling planning and coordination without coercive state power.

With the above, can you assess the likely material conditions for such a society and how would you define this economic system?
