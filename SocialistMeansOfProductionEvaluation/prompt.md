I'm going to describe an economic system to you, and I want you to give me the likely material conditions that would result from this means of production.

There is no passive income. There are no rents or private landownership. Instead, title to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use; legitimate ownership is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative.  Land is commonly held by locally run councils who manage access and settle disputes between claimants. A small fee is charged to cover services. Every individual has a guaranteed right to claim a parcel of land or a dwelling for personal residence, provided they occupy and use it. Local land councils must maintain sufficient housing stock or land availability to satisfy this right.

In this economic system, labor has primacy over capital. The labor market has been abolished, and no one can work for a wage or a salary. Instead, the institution of economic organization in this system is the workers' cooperative. Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned. Every member has a stake and one person, one vote in all workers' cooperative matters. Regarding remuneration, there cannot be more than a 33% spread between the highest-paid and lowest-paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops. The unions provide support and settle internal disputes that the cooperatives cannot resolve.

These cooperatives devise production plans indicating what they plan to purchase. All commodities and services are priced according to the labor theory of value. The assumption is that the market price the cooperative pays is as close to the real price as possible. These prices are used as signals of value throughout the system.

Once a cooperative's plan is ready, it is submitted to a People's Bank. The concept of the People's Banks is inspired by Proudhon's People's Bank.

However, unlike Proudhon's model, the People's Banks are not a monopoly. Instead, the People's Banks are workers' cooperatives that manage the financial sector of the economy. The People’s Banks review cooperative proposals and can make adjustments in conjunction with the cooperative and then issue loans in credits to fund production or services. These credits then circulate through the economy to facilitate commerce. As a cooperative then sells its products or services, it repays the loan. These loans provide a small boost to the People's Banks to cover operating costs only.

The credits issued by the People's Banks are a form of demurrage currency, as they expire five years after issuance. There are "savings accounts" where credits can be placed on hold and will not age for the time they are held within the account.  Once released the credits have the same value as credits circulating concurrently.  In recognition of the fact that capital is social in nature no member of federation can open such account individually.  Only cooperatives can use such accounts to assist in resource planning and to account for projects which would exceed the 5-year time frame for which the credits are valid.  Additionally, foreigners from capitalist economies can use such accounts such that credits can be used as fiat currency within their respective economies.  They would simply save the credits in the account and pull them from the account when needed.

Regarding foreign investment, foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives to produce goods and services. In such cases, the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery, and can pay for the work in foreign currency, which the People's Banks will convert into credits for internal use. This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign currency to facilitate international trade. For countries adopting this economic system, we would add them to the same economic area.

The state has been abolished and replaced with a workers' federation based on free association, not on a monopoly of violence. This is not a welfare state. Instead, people are encouraged to join publicly subsidized mutual aid associations. There is a federation-sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who cannot join another group.

These groups encourage mutual aid and mutual dependence rather than dependence on the federation.

The federation exists for the benefit of its members. It provides services and utilities to cooperatives to facilitate their operation.

Among these services, the federation can commission special federations of workers' cooperatives to complete mega-projects. It can also coordinate industry research projects by accepting contributions from cooperatives, which would entitle contributors to the benefits of the research.
