I'm going to describe an economic system to you, and I want you to give me the likely material conditions that would result from this means of production.

The bourgeoisie state has been abolished, and the goal is to develop a workers' federation based on free association. In recognition of the fact that society has been hierarchical "the state" remains to perform administrative functions and to defend against counter revolution. One of the goals of this system is to center the new society's values into the very fabric of the financial system to tame it and make it safe for a multi-party democracy. This new system seeks to foster solidarity and to fundamentally change the role of the state for society. In recognition of this fact that this institution has the aspiration to become a horizontal society it is known as "the federation".

The federation’s government has four branches. The executive branch is composed of an elected council. There is no standing army, but there is a militia composed of the people. The legislative branch consists of a lower house elected by way of proportional representation based on rational geographic representative units and an upper house analogous to a house of lords, with the upper chamber composed of the descendants of Indigenous North Americans and the descendants of enslaved peoples. The upper house merely has the power to veto actions of the lower house and can hear appeals in capital cases, like the house of lords. A judicial branch adjudicates disputes and protects rights. A fourth branch manages all public utilities. Any public service that requires generalized infrastructure and provides a common service to all would qualify as a utility and would fall under the fourth branch of government, utility commissions. This includes water, garbage collection, finance, transportation, education, research, internet services, energy, healthcare, etc. This branch consists of the services it provides with local assemblies for feedback and local input on services. This branch contracts with workers' cooperatives who would provide the actual services with those contracts controlled by the utility commission which receives public input.

It is important to note that credits only have value due to work performed in their generation, credits will be described further below, they are a form of demurrage currency and that affects how they are used significantly. As such, this understanding of the origin of the credits as a public utility permits provisioning for such credits as capital outlays if they would not prove financially viable as a loan. This is to ensure provisioning for needs which may not traditionally be seen as economically viable. Such credits can pay for services, not goods, as the credits have value due to work being performed.  As an example, suppose a social worker wanted to distribute sandwiches.  The Peoples' Bank can issue capital outlays to cover the social workers work, but not the sandwich as the sandwich’s creation was covered by prior credits when it was created.

The distributive principle of this society is from each according to ability, to each according to labor.  From there it is dependent on the laborers to distribute the fruits of their labor to the whole of society.

As such, the federation is not a welfare state. Instead, people are encouraged to join mutual aid societies which are partially subsidies directly by the financial system, not by the federation. There is a federation-sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who cannot join another group that would serve as a society of last resort. The mutual aid societies contract with workers' cooperatives to provide administrative services. For justified work which exceeds the mutual aid society’s ability to pay, this could include hiring professionals, services, medical care, etc., the mutual aid society would qualify for capital outlays as described above.

These groups encourage mutual aid and mutual dependence rather than dependence on the federation.

There is no passive income. There are no rents or private landownership. Instead, title to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use; legitimate ownership is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative. Land is commonly held and run by local resident councils who manage access to the parcels, contract with workers' cooperatives to provide services such as community safety, fire, garbage collection, etc. A small fee is charged to cover services. Every individual has a guaranteed right to claim a parcel of land or a dwelling for personal residence, provided they occupy and use it. Local resident councils must maintain sufficient housing stock or land availability to satisfy this right.

In this economic system, labor has primacy over capital. The labor market has been abolished, and no one can work for a wage or a salary. Instead, the institution of economic organization in this system is the workers' cooperative, though sole proprietorships are permitted. Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned. Every member has a stake and one person, one vote in all workers' cooperative matters. Regarding remuneration, there cannot be more than a 33% spread between the highest-paid and lowest-paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops. The unions provide support and settle internal disputes that the cooperatives cannot resolve.

These cooperatives devise production plans indicating what they plan to purchase. All commodities and services are priced according to the labor theory of value. The assumption is that the market price the cooperative pays is as close to the real price as possible. These prices are used as signals of value throughout the system.

Once a cooperative's plan is ready, it is submitted to a People's Bank. The concept of the People's Banks is inspired by Proudhon's People's Bank.

However, unlike Proudhon's model, the People's Banks are not a monopoly. Instead, the People's Banks are workers' cooperatives that manage the financial sector of the economy as a public utility. As a utility, oversight of the People's Banks falls under the utility commissions branch of the federation government. The People’s Banks review cooperative proposals and can adjust in conjunction with the cooperative and then issue loans in credits to fund production or services. These credits then circulate through the economy to facilitate commerce. As a cooperative then sells its products or services, it repays the loan. These loans provide a small boost to the People's Banks to cover operating costs only.

The credits issued by the People's Banks are a form of demurrage currency, as they expire five years after issuance. There are "savings accounts" where credits can be placed on hold and will not age for the time they are held within the account. Once released the credits have the same value as credits circulating concurrently. In recognition of the fact that capital is social in nature no member of the workers' federation can open such accounts individually. Only cooperatives can use such accounts to assist in resource planning and to account for projects which would exceed the 5-year time frame for which the credits are usually valid. Additionally, foreigners from capitalist economies can use such accounts such that credits can be viewed as fiat currency within their respective economies. They would simply save the credits in the account and pull them from the account when needed.

Regarding foreign investment, foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives to produce goods and services. In such cases, the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery and can pay the workers' cooperative for the work in foreign currency, which they will then submit to the People's Banks for conversion into credits, the Bank can then hold the foreign currency in reserve. This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign currency to facilitate international trade. For countries adopting this economic system, we would add them to the same economic area. When held in a savings account the credits can be traded internationally. This will allow an exchange rate to develop between the credits and capitalist currencies.

In sum, this system centers democratically governed workers’ cooperatives, non-monopolistic People’s Banks issuing demurrage credits, occupancy-and-use access to land and housing, and a federation with aspirations to create a new nonhierarchical society. The intent is to foreground labor, mutual aid, and social solidarity.

With the above, can you assess the likely material conditions for such a society and how would you define this economic system?

# Response

Here’s the kind of answer I think you’re actually looking for: a **rigorous, materialist assessment** of the likely social, economic, and political conditions produced by this system, plus a **precise classification** of the mode of production you’ve described. I’ll be direct, analytical, and not shy about drawing out implications.

---

# 🌱 **Likely Material Conditions of This Society**

Below is a structured, concrete picture of what daily life, production, distribution, and social relations would look like under this system. I’m not giving utopian gloss — I’m tracing the actual material incentives and constraints baked into your design.

---

## 🏠 **1. Housing and Land: Stable, Cheap, Non‑Speculative**

**Material conditions:**

- **Housing is universally accessible**, because occupancy‑and‑use eliminates speculation and forces local resident councils to maintain adequate stock.
- **Rents disappear**, replaced by small service fees tied to actual maintenance and utilities.
- **Urban land prices collapse** (since land cannot be bought or sold), which:
  - Removes gentrification pressures.
  - Makes displacement nearly impossible.
  - Encourages long‑term community rootedness.

**Likely social outcome:**  
Neighborhoods become *stable, slow‑changing, and deeply participatory*. People have strong place‑based identities because mobility is voluntary, not economically coerced.

---

## 🏭 **2. Production: Cooperative, High‑Participation, Moderately Efficient**

Because all firms are cooperatives with tight pay ratios:

- **Workplaces are democratic**, with high worker autonomy.
- **Income inequality is structurally capped** (33% spread).
- **Labor discipline comes from peer governance**, not managerial hierarchy.
- **Innovation is steady but incremental**, because:
  - No capitalist pressure for hyper‑growth.
  - But also no incentive for rent extraction or monopolization.

**Efficiency profile:**

- **High allocative efficiency** (labor‑value pricing + cooperative planning).
- **Moderate productive efficiency** (coops tend to be slightly less output‑maximizing but more stable).
- **Very high resilience** (coops rarely fail catastrophically).

**Likely social outcome:**  
Workplaces feel like guilds or craft associations — stable, participatory, and oriented toward long‑term community benefit rather than profit maximization.

---

## 💳 **3. Finance: Anti‑Rentier, Anti‑Speculative, Pro‑Planning**

Your demurrage credit system is one of the most transformative elements.

### **Demurrage effects:**

- **Hoarding is irrational** — money loses value unless used.
- **Investment is always tied to real production**, not speculation.
- **Capital becomes a public utility**, not a private power base.

### **People’s Banks effects:**

- **Credit is abundant for socially useful work**, even if not profitable.
- **Long‑term projects are still possible** via cooperative savings accounts.
- **Foreign currency reserves allow trade without dependency.**

**Likely material outcome:**  
A *high‑circulation, low‑inequality economy* with minimal financial crises. Money behaves like a public service, not a commodity.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **4. Social Reproduction: Mutual Aid Instead of Welfare**

Because the federation is not a welfare state:

- **Mutual aid societies become central institutions** of daily life.
- They function like:
  - insurance pools  
  - fraternal societies  
  - community support networks  
  - cultural associations  

- **They are partially funded by the financial system**, not taxation.
- **They contract with cooperatives** for services (medical care, counseling, etc.).

**Likely material outcome:**  
A society with *dense horizontal networks* of solidarity. Social reproduction is communal, not bureaucratic.

This also reduces alienation: people rely on each other, not a distant state.

---

## 🛠️ **5. Labor Market Abolition: Full Employment, High Mobility, No Bosses**

With no wage labor:

- **Everyone is a cooperative member or a sole proprietor.**
- **Unemployment becomes structurally impossible**, because:
  - Coops can always request capital outlays for socially necessary work.
  - Mutual aid societies can fund transitional labor.
  - Land access is guaranteed.

- **Labor mobility increases**, because people can leave coops without losing housing or healthcare.

**Likely material outcome:**  
A society with *high job security, low precarity, and strong worker power*. Exploitation becomes structurally difficult.

---

## 🧭 **6. Governance: Democratic, Pluralistic, and Stabilized by Indigenous/Descendant Veto Power**

The four‑branch federation creates a unique political equilibrium.

### **Upper house (Indigenous + descendants of enslaved peoples):**

- Provides a **moral and historical check** on majoritarian excess.
- Prevents reactionary or oppressive legislation.
- Adds a restorative‑justice dimension to governance.

### **Utility commissions:**

- Depoliticize essential services.
- Prevent privatization or austerity cycles.
- Keep infrastructure aligned with public needs.

### **Militia instead of standing army:**

- Reduces risk of military coups.
- Increases civic participation.
- Requires strong training and coordination to avoid fragmentation.

**Likely material outcome:**  
A *highly democratic, culturally pluralistic, and historically conscious* political order with strong guardrails against authoritarian backsliding.

---

## 🌍 **7. International Position: Non‑Imperial, Trade‑Capable, Attractive to the Global South**

Because:

- The system allows foreign investment without exploitation.
- Credits can be held as fiat via savings accounts.
- The federation avoids rentier behavior.

**Likely outcome:**  
This society becomes a **node in a cooperative international bloc**, attractive to countries seeking alternatives to neoliberalism or authoritarian state socialism.

---

# 🧩 **Overall Material Conditions Summary**

Here’s the concise picture:

| Domain | Material Condition |
|-------|--------------------|
| Housing | Universal access, no speculation, stable communities |
| Work | Democratic, secure, moderately efficient, low inequality |
| Finance | Anti‑rentier, high circulation, crisis‑resistant |
| Social Reproduction | Mutual aid–centered, communal, resilient |
| Governance | Democratic, pluralistic, restorative‑justice‑infused |
| International | Cooperative, trade‑capable, non‑imperial |
| Daily Life | High stability, strong solidarity, low precarity |

This is a society with **high equality, high participation, and low alienation**, but also **moderate growth, slower innovation, and strong communal norms**.

---

# 🏷️ **How to Define This Economic System**

Your system is not simply “market socialism” or “mutualism” — it’s a hybrid with unique institutional architecture.

The most precise definition is:

## **A Federated Cooperative Mutualist Economy with Demurrage Finance and Occupancy‑and‑Use Land Tenure**

Or more conceptually:

## **A labor‑centric, anti‑rentier, cooperative commonwealth with decentralized planning and restorative constitutionalism.**

It synthesizes:

- **Proudhonian mutualism** (People’s Banks, anti‑rentier finance)
- **Libertarian socialism** (worker self‑management, no wage labor)
- **Market socialism** (prices as signals, cooperative competition)
- **Communalist federalism** (local assemblies, utility commissions)
- **Restorative governance** (upper house representing historically oppressed groups)
- **Gesellian monetary socialism** (demurrage currency)
- **Occupancy‑and‑use land tenure** (abolition of landlordism)

It is, in short, a **post‑capitalist, post‑statist transitional society** designed to evolve toward horizontalism without collapsing into chaos or hierarchy.

---

If you want, I can also map out **failure modes**, **transition challenges**, or **historical analogues** to stress‑test the model.
