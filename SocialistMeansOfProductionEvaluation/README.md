I'm going to describe an economic system to you, and I want you to give me the likely material conditions that would result from this means of production.

The bourgeoisie state has been abolished, and the goal is to develop a workers' federation based on free association. In recognition of the fact that society has been hierarchical "the state" remains to perform administrative functions and to defend against counter revolution. One of the goals of this system is to center the new societies values into the very fabric of the financial system to tame it and make it safe for a multi-party democracy. This new system seeks to foster solidarity and to fundamentally change the role of the state for society. In recognition of this fact that this institution has the aspiration to become a horizontal society it is known as "the federation".

The federation’s government has four branches. The executive branch is composed of an elected council. There is no standing army, but there is a militia composed of the people. The legislative branch consists of a lower house elected by way of proportional representation based on rational geographic representative units and an upper house analogous to a house of lords, with the upper chamber composed of the descendants of Indigenous North Americans and the descendants of enslaved peoples. The upper house merely has the power to veto actions of the lower house and can hear appeals in capital cases, like the house of lords. A judicial branch adjudicates disputes and protects rights. A fourth branch manages all public utilities. Any public service that requires generalized infrastructure and provides a common service to all would qualify as a utility and would fall under the fourth branch of government, utility commissions. This includes water, garbage collection, finance, transportation, education, research, internet services, energy, healthcare, etc. This branch consists of the services it provides with local assemblies for feedback and local input on services. This branch contracts with workers' cooperatives who would provide the actual services with those contracts controlled by the utility commission which receives public input.

It is important to note that credits only have value due to work performed in their generation, credits will be described further below, they are a form of demurrage currency and that affects how they are used significantly. As such, this understanding of the origin of the credits as a public utility permits provisioning for such credits as capital outlays if they would not prove financially viable as a loan. This is to ensure provisioning for needs which may not traditionally be seen as economically viable. Such credits can pay for services, not goods, as the credits have value due to work being performed.  As an example, suppose a social worker wanted to distribute sandwiches.  The Peoples' Bank can issue capital outlays to cover the social workers work, but not the sandwich as the sandwich’s creation was covered by prior credits when it was created.

The distributive principle of this society is from each according to ability, to each according to labor.  From there it is dependent on the laborers to distribute the fruits of their labor to the whole of society.

As such, the federation is not a welfare state. Instead, people are encouraged to join mutual aid societies which are partially subsidies directly by the financial system, not by the federation. There is a federation-sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who cannot join another group that would serve as a society of last resort. The mutual aid societies contract with workers' cooperatives to provide administrative services. For justified work which exceeds the mutual aid society’s ability to pay, this could include hiring professionals, services, medical care, etc., the mutual aid society would qualify for capital outlays as described above.

These groups encourage mutual aid and mutual dependence rather than dependence on the federation.

There is no passive income. There are no rents or private landownership. Instead, title to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use; legitimate ownership is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative. Land is commonly held and run by local resident councils who manage access to the parcels, contract with workers' cooperatives to provide services such as community safety, fire, garbage collection, etc. A small fee is charged to cover services. Every individual has a guaranteed right to claim a parcel of land or a dwelling for personal residence, provided they occupy and use it. Local resident councils must maintain sufficient housing stock or land availability to satisfy this right.

In this economic system, labor has primacy over capital. The labor market has been abolished, and no one can work for a wage or a salary. Instead, the institution of economic organization in this system is the workers' cooperative. Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned. Every member has a stake and one person, one vote in all workers' cooperative matters. Regarding remuneration, there cannot be more than a 33% spread between the highest-paid and lowest-paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops. The unions provide support and settle internal disputes that the cooperatives cannot resolve.

These cooperatives devise production plans indicating what they plan to purchase. All commodities and services are priced according to the labor theory of value. The assumption is that the market price the cooperative pays is as close to the real price as possible. These prices are used as signals of value throughout the system.

Once a cooperative's plan is ready, it is submitted to a People's Bank. The concept of the People's Banks is inspired by Proudhon's People's Bank.

However, unlike Proudhon's model, the People's Banks are not a monopoly. Instead, the People's Banks are workers' cooperatives that manage the financial sector of the economy as a public utility. As a utility, oversight of the People's Banks falls under the utility commissions branch of the federation government. The People’s Banks review cooperative proposals and can adjust in conjunction with the cooperative and then issue loans in credits to fund production or services. These credits then circulate through the economy to facilitate commerce. As a cooperative then sells its products or services, it repays the loan. These loans provide a small boost to the People's Banks to cover operating costs only.

The credits issued by the People's Banks are a form of demurrage currency, as they expire five years after issuance. There are "savings accounts" where credits can be placed on hold and will not age for the time they are held within the account. Once released the credits have the same value as credits circulating concurrently. In recognition of the fact that capital is social in nature no member of the workers' federation can open such accounts individually. Only cooperatives can use such accounts to assist in resource planning and to account for projects which would exceed the 5-year time frame for which the credits are usually valid. Additionally, foreigners from capitalist economies can use such accounts such that credits can be viewed as fiat currency within their respective economies. They would simply save the credits in the account and pull them from the account when needed.

Regarding foreign investment, foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives to produce goods and services. In such cases, the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery and can pay the workers' cooperative for the work in foreign currency, which they will then submit to the People's Banks for conversion into credits, the Bank can then hold the foreign currency in reserve. This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign currency to facilitate international trade. For countries adopting this economic system, we would add them to the same economic area. When held in a savings account the credits can be traded internationally. This will allow an exchange rate to develop between the credits and capitalist currencies.

In sum, this system centers democratically governed workers’ cooperatives, non-monopolistic People’s Banks issuing demurrage credits, occupancy-and-use access to land and housing, and a federation with aspirations to create a new nonhierarchical society. The intent is to foreground labor, mutual aid, and social solidarity.

With the above, can you assess the likely material conditions for such a society and how would you define this economic system?

# Response

Here’s the kind of answer I think you’re actually looking for: a **rigorous, materialist assessment** of the likely social, economic, and political conditions produced by this system, plus a **precise classification** of the mode of production you’ve described. I’ll be direct, analytical, and not shy about drawing out implications.

---

# 🌱 **Likely Material Conditions of This System**

Below is a structured analysis of what daily life, class structure, production dynamics, and political culture would *materially* look like under this institutional design.

---

## 🏠 **1. Housing, Land, and Spatial Organization**
### **Guaranteed housing + occupancy-and-use tenure → extremely stable, low-cost living conditions**
- With no rents, no landlords, and no speculative land markets, housing costs collapse to **maintenance-only**.
- Resident councils become powerful local institutions, functioning like hyper-democratic municipal governments.
- Urban development becomes **slow, steady, and need-driven**, not speculative.
- Homelessness is structurally eliminated because access to a dwelling is a right and councils must maintain adequate stock.

### **Likely outcomes**
- High residential stability.
- Strong neighborhood-level democracy.
- Much lower wealth inequality (no real estate accumulation).
- Slower but more equitable urban development.

---

## 🏭 **2. Production, Work, and Cooperative Structure**
### **Universal worker cooperatives + no wage labor → a post-capitalist labor regime**
- Every firm is a cooperative with a tight 33% pay band.
- No labor market means no employers, no employees, no wages—only **membership and labor-based remuneration**.
- Unions act as internal governance stabilizers rather than adversarial bargaining agents.

### **Likely outcomes**
- High job security (firms rarely fire members; they reassign or retrain).
- Lower productivity growth compared to capitalism, but higher job satisfaction.
- Stronger workplace democracy, but slower decision-making.
- Reduced inequality and status hierarchy.

---

## 💳 **3. Finance, Investment, and Demurrage Credits**
### **Demurrage currency → high circulation, low hoarding, strong bias toward real economic activity**
- Credits expire after 5 years unless held in cooperative savings accounts.
- This creates a **“use it or lose it”** dynamic that:
  - discourages accumulation,
  - encourages reinvestment,
  - prevents financialization,
  - stabilizes multi-party democracy by removing concentrated capital power.

### **People’s Banks as cooperative utilities**
- They issue credit only for production or services.
- Capital outlays allow socially necessary but unprofitable work to occur.
- No profit-seeking finance sector exists.

### **Likely outcomes**
- Very low inequality in financial wealth.
- No speculative bubbles.
- Investment decisions become **collective, transparent, and slow**.
- Long-term megaprojects require cooperative savings accounts and federation coordination.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **4. Social Reproduction and Mutual Aid**
### **No welfare state → mutual aid societies as the core of social support**
- These societies become the primary institutions for:
  - healthcare access,
  - disability support,
  - elder care,
  - childcare,
  - emergency assistance.

### **Likely outcomes**
- Strong communal bonds and dense social networks.
- Social support becomes **horizontal**, not bureaucratic.
- Inequality between mutual aid societies is minimized by capital outlays.
- Social isolation is structurally discouraged.

---

## 🛠️ **5. Distribution and Consumption**
### **“To each according to labor” → a labor-value-based consumption system**
- Consumption is tied to labor contribution, not market wages.
- Cooperative members distribute surplus to society voluntarily, but norms of solidarity are strong.

### **Likely outcomes**
- Modest but universal consumption levels.
- Luxury goods exist but are rare and labor-intensive.
- Consumption patterns become more egalitarian and less status-driven.

---

## 🌐 **6. International Relations and Trade**
### **Credits as a demurrage currency + foreign savings accounts**
- Foreigners treat credits as fiat-like instruments.
- Exchange rates emerge organically.
- Foreign investment is allowed but strictly limited to **payment for labor**, not ownership.

### **Likely outcomes**
- Moderate integration with global markets.
- No foreign ownership of domestic assets.
- A stable but not highly competitive export sector.

---

## 🛡️ **7. Political Culture and Governance**
### **Four-branch federation → a hybrid of republicanism, Indigenous governance, and cooperative federalism**
- The upper house composed of descendants of Indigenous peoples and descendants of enslaved peoples institutionalizes historical justice.
- The militia-based defense system creates a highly civic political culture.
- Utility commissions become extremely powerful technocratic-democratic bodies.

### **Likely outcomes**
- High civic participation.
- Strong norms of solidarity and anti-hierarchy.
- Slow but deeply democratic decision-making.
- Low risk of oligarchic capture due to demurrage and cooperative finance.

# 🧭 **What Economic System Is This?**

Your system is not simply “socialism” or “mutualism” or “market socialism.” It is a **synthetic, hybrid mode of production** with clear lineage but also novel features.

The most accurate classification is:

## ⭐ **A Federated Cooperative Mutualist Economy with Demurrage Finance and Occupancy-and-Use Land Tenure**

More analytically, it is:

### **A form of post-capitalist, labor-centered, low-communism with mutualist and Proudhonian influences, structured through cooperative federalism and demurrage-based monetary governance.**

It combines:
- **Mutualism** (Proudhon’s influence, People’s Banks, occupancy-and-use land)
- **Market socialism** (cooperative production, labor-value pricing)
- **Communal federalism** (resident councils, utility commissions)
- **Democratic confederalism** (militia, assemblies, decentralized governance)
- **Low communism** (abolition of wage labor, no private land, no passive income)
- **Gesellian monetary theory** (demurrage currency)

It is not anarchism because the federation remains.
It is not Marxist-Leninist because there is no vanguard or state ownership of production.
It is not capitalism because there is no wage labor, no capital markets, no rents, and no private land.

It is its own coherent mode of production.

---

# 🔮 **Summary of Material Conditions**
If implemented successfully, this society would likely exhibit:

- **Low inequality**
- **High social cohesion**
- **Universal housing**
- **Stable but modest living standards**
- **High job satisfaction but slower productivity growth**
- **Strong local democracy**
- **Minimal financial crises**
- **A culture of solidarity over competition**
- **A post-capitalist class structure centered on cooperative membership**

It would be a society that trades some dynamism and rapid innovation for stability, equality, and deep democratic participation.

If you want, I can also map out:
- the class structure that would emerge,
- the likely contradictions or failure points,
- how this system would evolve over 50–100 years,
- or how it compares to historical analogues like Mondragón, Rojava, or Proudhon’s proposals.

Just tell me which direction you want to explore next.
