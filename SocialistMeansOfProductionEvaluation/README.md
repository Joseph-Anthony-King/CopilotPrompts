# **Prompt Submitted to Copilot**

I'm going to describe an economic system to you, and I want you to give me the likely material conditions that would result from this means of production.

In this economic system, labor has primacy over capital. The labor market has been abolished, and no one can work for a wage or a salary. Instead, the institution of economic organization in this system is the workers' cooperative. Workers' cooperatives are collectively owned. Every member has a stake and one person, one vote in all workers' cooperative matters. Regarding remuneration, there cannot be more than a 25% spread between the highest-paid and lowest-paid members of the collective.

All cooperatives are also union shops. The unions provide support and settle internal disputes that the cooperatives cannot resolve.

These cooperatives devise production plans indicating what they plan to purchase. All commodities and services are priced according to the labor theory of value. The assumption is that the market price the cooperative pays is as close to the real price as possible. These prices are used as signals of value throughout the system.

Once a cooperative's plan is ready, it is submitted to a People's Bank. The concept of the People's Banks is inspired by Proudhon's People's Bank.

However, unlike Proudhon's model, the People's Banks are not a monopoly. Instead, the People's Banks are workers' cooperatives that manage the financial sector of the economy. The People’s Banks review cooperative proposals can make adjustments in conjunction with the cooperative, and then issue loans in credits to fund production or services. These credits then circulate through the economy to facilitate commerce. As a cooperative then sells its products or services, it repays the loan. These loans provide a small boost to the People's Banks to cover operating costs only.

The credits issued by the People's Banks are a form of demurrage currency, as they expire five years after issuance.

One additional point regarding these credits: if placed in a "savings" account, the credits are frozen for the time they remain in the account. Once released, they are equivalent in value to contemporary credits. Foreigners can use such accounts to preserve value for future use.

Regarding foreign investment, foreign buyers can contract with workers' cooperatives to produce goods and services. In such cases, the foreign investor would provide the physical capital and machinery, and can pay for the work in foreign currency, which the People's Banks will convert into credits for internal use. This will also provide the People's Banks with foreign currency to facilitate international trade. For countries adopting this economic system, we would add them to the same economic area.

The state has been abolished and replaced with a workers' federation based on free association, not on a monopoly of violence. This is not a welfare state. Instead, people are encouraged to join publicly subsidized mutual aid associations. There is a federation-sponsored mutual aid society for anyone who cannot join another group.

These groups encourage mutual aid and mutual dependence rather than dependence on the federation.

The federation exists for the benefit of its members. It provides services and utilities to cooperatives to facilitate their operation.

Among these services, the federation can commission special federations of workers' cooperatives to complete mega-projects. It can also coordinate industry research projects by accepting contributions from cooperatives, which would entitle contributors to the benefits of the research.

There is no passive income. There are no rents or private landownership. Instead, title to a parcel of land is based on occupancy and use; legitimate ownership is conditional upon active use and occupation by an individual or cooperative.

With the above, can you assess the likely material conditions for such a society?:

# Response

You’ve outlined a fully labor‑centric, cooperative, anti‑rentier economy with demurrage money, mutual‑aid governance, and a stateless federation. It’s a rich system, and we can map out the likely **material conditions**—the day‑to‑day lived reality—by looking at how each structural feature shapes incentives, production, and social life.

Below is a clear, grounded, and non‑romanticized assessment of what such a society would probably look like.

---

# 🌱 **Likely Material Conditions of This Economic System**

## 🧩 **1. Income, Inequality, and Class Structure**
### **Extremely Low Income Inequality**
- A 25% pay‑spread cap essentially eliminates high‑income classes.
- No passive income, no rents, and no capital ownership outside cooperatives remove the traditional capitalist class entirely.
- Wealth accumulation is limited by demurrage currency and the absence of land speculation.

### **Resulting Conditions**
- **Narrow consumption differences** between individuals.
- **No wealthy elite**, but also **no extreme poverty**, since cooperative membership guarantees a livelihood.
- Social status likely tied to **skill, reputation, and cooperative contribution**, not wealth.

---

## 🏭 **2. Production, Innovation, and Efficiency**
### **Cooperative Planning + Market Signals**
- Production is decentralized but coordinated through People’s Banks.
- Prices reflect labor time, not profit maximization.

### **Likely Outcomes**
- **Stable but moderate growth**: cooperatives aim for sustainability, not expansion.
- **Innovation continues**, but:
  - It is **incremental**, not driven by venture‑capital‑style risk.
  - Breakthrough innovation depends on **federation‑coordinated research pools**.
- **Efficiency varies**:
  - High in sectors where workers directly experience the benefits (manufacturing, services).
  - Lower in sectors requiring large upfront investment or long‑term risk (pharma, aerospace, frontier tech).

---

## 🧺 **3. Consumer Goods and Living Standards**
### **General Abundance of Basics**
- Food, housing, utilities, and everyday goods are reliably produced because cooperatives have stable incentives to meet community needs.

### **But Limited Variety and Luxury Goods**
- Without profit incentives or high‑income consumers, luxury markets shrink dramatically.
- Product lines tend to be **functional, durable, and standardized**.
- Fashion, electronics, and entertainment exist, but with fewer variants and slower cycles.

### **Overall Living Standard**
- **Comfortable, egalitarian, and secure**, but not consumerist.
- Think: high‑quality basics, fewer extravagances.

---

## 🏘️ **4. Housing and Land Use**
### **No Private Land Ownership**
- Land is held only through **use and occupancy**.
- No landlords, no rent, no speculation.

### **Material Consequences**
- Housing is **abundant and affordable**, because:
  - Cooperatives or individuals build for use, not profit.
  - Vacant property is quickly reallocated.
- Urban development is **functional**, not speculative.
- Gentrification as we know it disappears.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **5. Social Relations and Community Life**
### **High Social Cohesion**
- Mutual aid associations replace welfare bureaucracies.
- People rely on each other, not a distant state.

### **Likely Cultural Traits**
- Strong norms of **solidarity**, **participation**, and **collective responsibility**.
- Social pressure to contribute meaningfully to cooperatives and mutual aid groups.
- Community life is dense and participatory—closer to a guild‑like civic culture.

---

## 🏛️ **6. Governance and the Workers’ Federation**
### **No State, but Strong Institutions**
- The federation coordinates infrastructure, research, and mega‑projects.
- Dispute resolution is handled by unions and federated councils.

### **Material Effects**
- Public services (transport, energy, water, communications) are:
  - Cooperative‑run,
  - Federation‑coordinated,
  - Universally accessible.

- Governance is **slow but democratic**, with many assemblies and councils.
- High civic participation is necessary to keep the system functioning.

---

## 💱 **7. Currency, Savings, and Investment**
### **Demurrage Currency**
- Money loses validity after five years unless frozen in savings.
- This discourages hoarding and encourages circulation.

### **Material Consequences**
- **High economic velocity**: people spend or invest rather than accumulate.
- Savings exist but are **non‑interest‑bearing**.
- Investment is channeled through People’s Banks, not private capital markets.

### **Financial Sector**
- Stable, low‑risk, low‑return.
- No speculation, no bubbles, no financial crises of the capitalist type.

---

## 🌍 **8. Foreign Trade and International Position**
### **Foreign Investment Allowed, but Controlled**
- Foreign capital enters only as machinery or currency converted into credits.
- No foreign ownership of domestic enterprises.

### **Likely Outcomes**
- The economy is **open but insulated**.
- Trade is balanced and stable.
- The system is attractive to:
  - Countries seeking autonomy from global capital,
  - Movements favoring cooperative or mutualist structures.

---

## ⚙️ **9. Labor, Work Culture, and Daily Life**
### **No Wage Labor**
- Everyone is a cooperative member.
- Work resembles a mix of:
  - Democratic workplace,
  - Guild,
  - Community enterprise.

### **Material Conditions**
- **High job security**.
- **Moderate work hours**, since cooperatives can self‑regulate.
- **High job satisfaction** in many sectors due to autonomy.
- But:
  - Decision‑making can be slow.
  - Some unpleasant jobs may require rotation or higher labor‑time valuation.

---

# 🧭 **Overall Material Picture**

### **What life feels like**
- Stable, egalitarian, and community‑oriented.
- Material security is high.
- Consumer choice is narrower.
- Innovation is steady but not explosive.
- Social life is participatory and cooperative.
- Inequality is minimal.
- Housing is abundant and non‑speculative.
- Workplaces are democratic and secure.
- The financial system is stable and modest.

### **In short**
A society that is **materially comfortable**, **deeply egalitarian**, and **socially cohesive**, with a slower but more stable economic rhythm and a strong emphasis on mutual responsibility.

- **Potential failure modes** of this system,
- **Historical analogues** (Mondragón, Proudhon, Yugoslav self‑management, etc.),
- Or a **fictional scenario** describing daily life inside it.
